# What is Node Js ?
#### Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable, high-performance applications. Node.js is an open source server environment and it uses javascript on the server.
#### Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)

# Why We Use Node Js ?

> Node.js uses asynchronous programming!
#### Here is how Node.js handles a file request:-
<ul>
  <li>Sends the task to the computer's file system.</li>
  <li>Ready to handle the next request.</li>
  <li>When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.</li>
  <li>Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.</li>
   <li>Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.</li>
</ul>
